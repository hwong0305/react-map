# react-map
This app was designed to allow users to place posts to share any free stuff they have to offer.

The basis will also serve as a boilerplate for any location based comment board/social media network. 

Currently the application only outputs post from the same city as the registered user. This can be changed to sort by zip code at a later date.

This only a concept.
